A simple and functional parking lot management system built in C#.  
It registers vehicles, assigns parking spots, calculates fees based on parking time, and displays the availability of all spots.

## 📘 Description

**Parking Lot Project with C#** is a console-based system designed to manage vehicle entries, exits, fees, and parking spot availability.

The code was developed as part of my learning journey with the C# language —  
**this was the first full project I built using C#**, serving as a hands-on way to explore object-oriented programming and .NET fundamentals.

## 🎯 Motivation / Why This Project Exists

The goal behind this project was to:

- Strengthen my understanding of C# fundamentals  
- Practice object-oriented design (classes, encapsulation, responsibilities)  
- Solve a real-world problem: organizing and controlling a parking lot  
- Learn how to structure a console application with clean logic  
- Explore data validation and business rules  

It is intentionally simple, but built with clarity and good structure in mind.
